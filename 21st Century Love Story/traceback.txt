I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 879, in script
    n neutral "I bet you were wondering if this happens often. And yes, it does. It's natural that people are always stunned by presence!"
Exception: Say has image attributes ('neutral',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
